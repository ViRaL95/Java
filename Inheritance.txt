In the preceding lessons, you have seen inheritance mentioned several times. In the Java language, classes can be derived from other classes, thereby inheriting fields and methods from those classes.

: A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). 

The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).



Classes can be derived from classes that are derived from classes that are derived from classes, and so on, and ultimately derived from the topmost class, Object. Such a class is said to be descended from all the classes in the inheritance chain stretching back to Object. 

The subclass only inherites the parameters from the base class that arent private. 

Constructors can not be overriden

We can invoke the constructor of the superclass by using the keyword super or by simply calling the constructor.
